How to use Opti-Cart:

BEFORE YOU RUN:
CLion has trouble establishing a proper working directory, even within cmake-build-debug, so if you're using it, go to "Run" > "Edit Configuration" and set the working directory to the root project folder.

For example, my working directory is set to: "C:\Users\Marvens\Documents\GitHub\Project-3-DSA"

After that, you're all set to run the main function!

Here are the steps for using Opti-Cart!
1. Input a minimum vendor rating for the card you're searching for (1-5, no decimals)
2. Input a minimum vendor # of sales. (1 = 10,000, 2 = 20,000, etc.)
3. Input the card name (Only the first 150 Pokemon G1 cards are currently available)
4. Input the quantity of cards you'd like to find under that Pokemon name. (Maximum of 9 cards per Pokemon)
5. Click on the search button, and you're all set to compare the First Fit vs Best Fit algorithms! You can keep adding Pokemon to your cart if you'd like and then rerun the search.
